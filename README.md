## Overview of Surfs Up Challenge Analysis
The initial request was to evaluate a surf n' shake shop opportunity with another investor.   He had previously invested in such a property which was rained out of existence.   A data set was provided by W. Avy to help with the analysis of weather patterns on the island.   After completing the additional analysis another request came in for further investigation.   Additional analsis was requested specifically for the months of June and December in Oahu to determine if the business model is a good year round investment.

- The main three differences between the analysis of June vs. Decembver are as follows:   
- Overall both data sets are very large totaling between 1700 and 1517 data points respectivley
- Both data sets showed a temp mean of over 70 degrees however the June temperatures were warmer by about 3 degrees
- The minimum temp was lower in December (not suprisingly" by 9 degrees
- However the maximum temp for the time periods were only different by 2 degrees  showing 85 vs. 83 respectiveley 
- Although there is a slight difference in smple size I do not beleive it is enough to sway the data in either instance analyzed

Based on the analysis completed the temperature should not play a major role in the success of the business venture in Oahu.   Looking at the precipitation amounts done in the additional queries i would say that the business would slow down for two reasons in December.   Both have lower temperatures overall and the average rainfall is also higher in the winter.   Those two combined would make for a slower season than in summer but makes sense when poeple would rather be both surfing and eating ice cream which lends both to hot weather.
