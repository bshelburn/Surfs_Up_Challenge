## Overview of Surfs Up Challenge Analysis
After completing the initial requested analysis with Bobby using SQL and CSV files a new request was issued.   This request was to do a deep dive of the Pewlette-Hackard employees to identify the number of potentially retiring employees by title and those that would be eligible for a mentorship program to help avoid any employee shortages.

- The above analysis shows the total count of employees who fall into the retirement criteria given.   
- Approximately 90,000 current employees fit the criteria for retirement out of the total employee pool of approximately 300,000 employees.
- The hardest hit employee level is at the "Senior" level with almost 60,000 employees which accounts for almost 66% of the total potential retirees.

## Surfs Up Analysis Summary & Additional Queries 
Based on the analysis the Pewlett-Hackard initiative was absolutley needed if the given age retirement metrics ring true.   I would recommend a company wide survey to determine when the Senior employees are planning on retiring and if there are potential short term monetary incentives to smooth the rate at which they retire.
